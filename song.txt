Oh my love we've had
Our share of tears
Oh my friends we've had
Our hopes and fears
Oh my friend it's been
A long hard year
But now it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas

The moon and stars
Seem awful cold and bright
Let's hope the snow will
Make this Christmas right

My friend the world will share
This special night
Because it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one night
Thank God it's Christmas
Yeah thank God it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Can it be Christmas
Let it be Christmas every day
